### "The best officers eat last. The best architects still code."

I am an **Engineering Director** and **Systems Architect** operating at the intersection of business strategy and technical execution.

I reject the idea that leadership means losing touch with the tools. Whether orchestrating an ERP rollout or writing Python automation to kill drudgery, I lead from the front.

### 🛠️ The Workbench
* **Core Stack:** `Python` `AWS` `Terraform` `Postgres`
* **Automation:** `n8n` `OpenAI API` `Anthropic API`
* **Leadership:** `Strategic Operations` `Team Scaling` `Technical Roadmaps`

### 📡 Active Protocols (What I'm Building)
* **Autonomous Agents:** Building self-healing workflows using Python and LLMs to automate operational inefficiencies.
* **Systems Architecture:** Designing event-driven pipelines that reduce latency and decouple monolithic dependencies.
* **The Craft:** Deepening knowledge in Event-Driven Architectures and Self-Hosted Automation.

### 🌲 The Offline
When the terminal is closed, I am usually found:
* **In the stream:** Fly fishing for trout in PA.
* **In the gym:** Training for strength and resilience.
* **At the roaster:** Sourcing and roasting single-origin coffee.
